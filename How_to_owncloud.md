# Cloud computing system supported by Charité IT

Instead of using dropbox we have owncloud for file sharing (e.g. code and documents). It is currently not recommended for data storage.  

# How to get access to Own cloud

send an email to jakob.kaminski@charite.de (who takes care of owncloud for AG Lernen) requesting access to owncloud

# Download a Desktopclient

https://owncloud.org/download/

Install the client on C:\ should be possible without admin rights. If not, ask IT to install it, by writing a ticket.

Set owncloud folder to T:\ if to small ask IT to increase quota.
